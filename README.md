# Welcome to BuildingGadgets-GTNH

`BuildingGadgets-GTNH` is as fork, and backport of direwolf20's building gadget mod. It is not currently associated with
GTNH, but it was backported for the sole purpose of use in GTNH. As a result it is currently not supported outside of 
GTNH.

Its behavior closely matches the upstream's functionality in 1.12.x. It does not aim to be a perfect port, but instead 
is focused on the functionality.  

It is currently in alpha, and as a result the functionality, and docs are partially stubbed.

## Usage

Since this is a backport, it's functionality can be gleamed by looking at the upstream documentation, and videos.

Refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Direwolf20-MC/BuildingGadgets/wiki) and well as Direwolf's Spotlights of the 
original - [Spotlight Part One](https://youtu.be/D4Ib4h7aTSk) and [Spotlight Part Two](https://youtu.be/JS1Xx_kwQQ0)

### Schematics
This backport supports a subset of 1.12.x schematics. Schematics for the original 1.12.x version can be found [here](https://airtable.com/appSIzYTsvPm6ZgfA/shrahfRhFpKhukLKo/tblAWiuX4jWq85tYZ).

### Installing the mod
**First**, grab [forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net) and install it using the installer. **Second**, pick up [Building Gadgets](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/building-gadgets) from CurseForge, **Third**, drop the hot stuff into your `mods` folder (*Psst* It's in `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods`), **Finally**, Enjoy

*Bonus: Find a bug and report it for a cookie*

### Using the Gadgets
Building gadgets has grown a lot since its initial release to the point that we have multiple tools for every occasion,
Our wiki has a great set of instructions on how to use each of our Gadgets, check out the [Building Gadget](https://github.com/Direwolf20-MC/BuildingGadgets/wiki/Building-Gadget), the
[Exchanger Gadget](https://github.com/Direwolf20-MC/BuildingGadgets/wiki/Exchanger-Gadget), the [Copy Paste Gadget](https://github.com/Direwolf20-MC/BuildingGadgets/wiki/Copy-Paste-Gadget), or the [Destruction Gadget](https://github.com/Direwolf20-MC/BuildingGadgets/wiki/Destruction-Gadget)

## Credit

The fork was in no way possible without the `Brachy`, and `Recursive Pineapple` from the GTNH discord. Recursive 
Pineapple's MatterManipulator mod provided.  

An especially big thanks to all of our [contributors](https://github.com/robbert229/BuildingGadgets/graphs/contributors) for the continued support, bug reports and PR's. All of the [Forge Guys](https://github.com/orgs/MinecraftForge/people) and the creators off Minecraft (Duh)
